semanticgraph
=============
This is the Django + Neo4j + D3.js project I created while I was working on a semantic network mining and visualization application. I think it's a good fit for many similar semantic visualization idea so I uploaded here. The customized purejs.js file owe much credit to [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [Christopher Gandrud's](http://christophergandrud.github.io/d3Network/#forceDirect) collapsible force directed network, but also combined with many useful tweaks to force directed graph such as calculating node's and rel's neighbors and graph filtering.

Dependency
============
Under the forked directory, run the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
